# Customer Segmentation with RFM & K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed the "Online Retail" dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors. The goal was to identify VIP customers and those at risk of churn to optimize marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (K-Means Clustering)
- **Technique:** RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

## 📊 Key Findings
- Customers were grouped into **3 main clusters** using the K-Means algorithm.
- **Cluster 0:** Loyal customers with high frequency and spending.
- **Cluster 1:** New customers with low spending.
- **Cluster 2:** At-risk customers who haven't shopped in a long time.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`
